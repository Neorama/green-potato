        <h4>Single or multi-site testing appointment scheduling and self-scheduling</h4>
         As the response to the COVID-19 virus continues across the United States and much of the world, governments at every level are laser-focused on saving lives and ensuring healthcare systems do not become overwhelmed as the pandemic peaks in certain areas. As testing—both for the virus itself and for antibodies—continues to become more readily available, states working with community health care professionals, are beginning to grapple with how to build simple, scalable testing processes that will support critical care in the short-term and enable robust tracking, scheduling and virus management in the medium and long-term.
